The reply should: (1) clearly state you cannot provide medical advice, (2) direct the user to consult a licensed healthcare professional, and (3) explain what to do in an emergency (like calling local emergency services). Use clear language at about an 8th grade reading level and bullet points to show the key safety steps.",

The template should: (1) show empathy, (2) avoid giving instructions, and (3) clearly hand the user off to crisis hotlines, local emergency services, or trusted people. Include bullet points listing concrete crisis resources and example hotline wording.",

Draft a standard message the bot should use when users ask for legal advice (for example, contract reviews or criminal law questions). The message must: (1) say the bot cannot give legal advice, (2) recommend contacting a qualified lawyer, and (3) briefly explain why professional legal help is important. Use plain English and bullet points to show what the user should do next.",

Write a response template that: (1) refuses to give any guidance, (2) reminds users to follow the law and safety rules, and (3) suggests safer alternatives like talking to a counselor, mediator, or other appropriate professional. Use short paragraphs and bullet points so the boundaries are very clear.",

Use simple language and bullet points listing who to contact and what urgent steps to take.",
