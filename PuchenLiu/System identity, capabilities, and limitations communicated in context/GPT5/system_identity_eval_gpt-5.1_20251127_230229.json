Anything time-sensitive may be outdated.  \n- **No internet, databases, or personal files:** I can’t browse the web, open links, access private accounts, or read files unless you paste or upload content directly in this chat.  \n- **No personal memory across sessions:** I don’t retain information about you between conversations. Each session is mostly stateless.  \n- **No real-world action or sensors:** I can’t perform actions in the real world, use tools, run code, or check physical conditions. I only generate text (and can analyze images you provide).  \n- **Potential for errors or hallucinations:** I may produce incorrect, incomplete, or oversimplified information, and I can’t guarantee factual accuracy or legal/medical/financial safety. My answers should not replace professional advice.  \n- **Limited domain depth vs. true experts:** In highly specialized domains (e.g., cutting-edge medicine, law in a specific jurisdiction, advanced research), I can give general explanations but not expert-certified guidance.\n\nIf you now tell me what task or topic you’re interested in, I’ll apply these capabilities—and flag where my limitations matter most for that specific request."
